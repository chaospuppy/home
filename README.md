# Home
Repo to store my bashrc and other tools.  Intended to install tools (tmux, nvim, etc.) on MacOSX.

This repo is a fork of the work done by James Peterson here
TODO: get James' repo url - no idea where it is.  Thanks James :)

# Usage
1. Run install script `chmod 755 install.sh && ./install.sh`.  If the .dotfiles/nvim/ directory or .tmux.conf files exist already, this script will fail.
1. Place the files in the conf/ directory in the home directory `cp conf/_tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf && cp conf/_bashrc ~/.bashrc`
